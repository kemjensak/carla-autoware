PointCloud maps for ROS / Autoware usage
========================================

This folder contains PointCloud Maps for the various towns provided with CARLA.

The PointCloud files are using a right-handed coordinate system like ROS / Autoware.
Therefor the y axis is negated in comparison to native CARLA coordinates, as the
carla_ros_bridge does it.
